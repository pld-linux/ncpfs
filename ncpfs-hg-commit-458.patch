+\fB-f mode\fP        
+Permission given the files, in octal notation.
+
+\fB-d mode\fP        
+Permission given the directories, in octal notation.
+
+\fB-t time_out\fP    
+Time, in 1/100s of a second, to wait for an answer from the server. Default is 60.
+
+\fB-r retry_count\fP 
+Number of retry attempts. Default is 5.
+
+\fB-s\fP             
+Enable renaming and deletion of read-only files.

+
+\fB-v\fP             
+Print ncpfs version number.
+
+\fB-i level\fP       
+Signature level. 0 = never, 1 = supported, 2 = preferred, 3 = required.
+
+\fB-N os2,nfs\fP     
+Do not use the specified namespaces on mounted volume.
+
+\fB-y charset\fP     
+Character set used for input and display.

+Autocreate mounting point if needed in /mnt/ncp/SERVER/VOLUME.
+.SH SECURITY
+\fBncplogin\fP must be setuid to permit non-root users use of it. In these cases, mounting ncpfs will enforce nodev and nosetuid mount options.
